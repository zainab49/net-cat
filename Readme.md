## Net-Cat
This project consists on recreating the NetCat in a Server-Client Architecture that can run in a server mode on a specified port listening for incoming connections, and it can be used in client mode, trying to connect to a specified port and transmitting information to the server.

## To run the server
-Clone or download this repository
-Navigate to the project directory and enter the server directory
-Open the terminal 
-Run the following command:
  (go run .) will have a default port of 8080, if you want to change it, you can run (go run. #port)

## To connect as a client
In linux terminal or WSL terminal for windows users run the following command:
nc <SERVER_IP> <PORT> 
-SERVER_IP: is the IP of the server given when u run it 
-PORT: is the port of the server 8989 or the one that u specified it
-When prompted, provide a username and thats it!
Enjoy connecting and chating with ur friends and family :)
